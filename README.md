# Rename files with regex.

> rn [options] [-o origin -s substitute] [files]

Use command "sed" to substitute the original filename. If the "origin" 
and "substitute" are not given, you can still change the letter case and/or
add serial number at the beginning of the filename.

See "rn --help" for details.

See "rn --example" for examples.
